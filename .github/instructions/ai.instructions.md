# Ethos AI Instructions

## Required Workflow

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING, you MUST:**

1. **Read ALL documentation in the `.ai/` folder**

   - Scan the entire `.ai/` directory and read every `.md` file
   - These files contain current project status, architecture, and implementation details
   - The documentation is concise and optimized for AI agents

2. **Acknowledge understanding** by referencing specific patterns you'll follow

3. **THEN proceed with your task**

## Key Context

Ethos is a decentralized digital rights data collection system. Phase 1 (crawling) is complete, Phase 2 (storage) is current focus. Follow established patterns from the documentation.
