# Ethos AI Instructions

## Required Workflow

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING, you MUST:**

1. **Read ALL applicable `.ai` documentation in this order:**

   - `.ai/project_context.md` - Project overview and development phases
   - `.ai/library_architecture.md` - Core architecture and patterns
   - `.ai/storage_architecture.md` - Storage design and migration
   - `.ai/cli_interface.md` - CLI commands and usage
   - `.ai/analysis_framework.md` - Data analysis components
   - `.ai/codex_integration.md` - Codex storage integration (if working with node/notifier)

2. **Acknowledge understanding by stating:**

   - "After reading .ai/[FILE].md, I understand that..."
   - Reference specific patterns you'll follow

3. **THEN proceed with your task**
