# Contributing to Ethos

## Workflow

1. **Find an issue** - Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
2. **Create branch** - `feature/123-description` (where 123 is issue number)
3. **Make changes** - TypeScript, no `any` types
4. **Test** - `pnpm build` and manual testing
5. **Submit PR** - Reference issue number: "Closes #123"

## Code Style

- **BiomeJS** handles linting and formatting
- **lefthook** runs pre-commit hooks
- **TypeScript** strict mode, full type safety
- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.

## AI Development

The `.ai/` directory contains documentation for AI agents helping with development. If you're using AI tools, they should read those docs first to understand the project.
