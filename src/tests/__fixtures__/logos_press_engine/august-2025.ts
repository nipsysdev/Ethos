---------------------

Logos is a movement committed to reshaping how people come together and organise. Achieving this vision depends on the dedication of an engaged, motivated community. If our [principles](https://logos.co/) resonate with you, we invite you to contribute your skills and creativity. We recognise and support those who choose to build with us.

We’ve just launched a community contributions portal, which makes it easy to submit proposals to make technical and non-technical contributions to Logos (including writing for Logos Press Engine). [Check out the Logos Contribute portal](https://contribute.logos.co/en/) and start contributing to the Logos movement today!

### Learning

_**Farewell to Westphalia**_

We’re thrilled to reveal that _Farewell to Westphalia_, coauthored by Logos cofounder Jarrad Hope and author of _Crypto Anarchy, Cyberstates, and Pirate Utopias_, Peter Ludlow, will be available in paperback, ereader edition, and as a free download on 16 September.

The book presents blockchain technology as infrastructure for a peaceful revolution in the way we organise and cooperate. It opens with a critique of the current nation-state system, arguing that new global issues are forcing nations to cede sovereignty to non-state entities. It then makes the case for blockchain’s potential to bring transparency, efficiency, and accountability to all levels of governance. [Learn more](https://logos.co/farewell-to-westphalia/). 

[Preorders for the ereader edition are live now](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FMGNN2ZT). If you own a Kindle and are interested in the book’s ideas, please consider preordering – it will really help boost the book’s chart position, exposing it to more people who may find value in its content.

As 16 September approaches, we’re ramping up promotional activities, including appearances by the authors on relevant podcasts, like the one below. We’re also appealing to the Logos community to help us get _Farewell to Westphalia_ into legacy education institutions. If you have relevant contacts from universities or libraries, or if you know of any appropriate bookshops that might want to stock the book, please email [pressengine@logos.co](mailto:pressengine@logos.co).

**Logos Press Engine**

We’re thrilled to see more community members contributing to Logos Press Engine. We’re currently working with two contributors to publish their writing. They’ll be available to read on the LPE very soon. Thanks for the submissions, JosiahWarren and Severoni! 

If you have something to add to the alternative governance conversation, why not submit a Logos Press Engine article proposal? Head to the new [Logos Contribute portal](https://contribute.logos.co/en/) to start contributing to Logos Press Engine.

**X Spaces** 

Logos hosts regular X Spaces with those at the forefront of governance and technological innovation. August’s Spaces tackled such topics as stablecoins, CBDCs, cognitive sovereignty, free media, and freethinking in cyberstates and blockchain communities, with widely known speakers in the liberty space and the crypto community. Guests included entrepreneur, investor, and activist Aaron Day, Jason Bassler and Matt Savoy from the Free Thought Project, and cognitive scientist Anna Riedl.

### Logos IRL

**Logos Circles**

Logos Circles are regular meetups held in various hubs around the world and in cyberspace. Their aim is to expand the Logos community and identify issues that Logos technologies and grassroots collective action can address. 

Last month, a new Circle formed – Logos Circle: Los Angeles. Hosted at the Arts District Brewing Company, the event was attended by a good mix of developers and non-developers. Alongside conversations about Logos and our goals, we were delighted to see one attendee dive right into [Waku](https://waku.org/), spinning up an nwaku node and praising the [project’s documentation](https://docs.waku.org/). We also started a book-sharing initiative, with five copies of _Farewell to Westphalia_ loaned out, and those receiving it asked to write a message in the cover for its next recipient. 

[Read more about Logos Circle: Los Angeles](https://forum.logos.co/t/logos-circle-los-angeles/485/7) and stay tuned for more information about the next LA Circle via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/logosnetwork) and the [Logos X account](https://x.com/logos_network).

In August, Logos Circle: Lisbon connected with the community of Quinta do Mocho, a public housing neighbourhood with a strong African diasporic identity and vibrant underground culture. We explored opportunities to collaborate on a creative hub, Parallel Society side events, and integrating local freelancers into the Talude decentralised marketplace.

The next Lisbon Circle will be held at the Well Read book shop again on 1 October. [More information](https://luma.com/LCLisbon5). 

Logos Circle: Zanzalu moved forward with its initiative to supply the Straight Learning Center in Zanzibar with the computing equipment mentioned in last month’s [State of the Logos Network](https://press.logos.co/article/july-2025). Ten Raspberry Pis were delivered to the school this week, and all further donations will go toward securing one month’s rent payment for this fantastic educational initiative. If you have something to spare, [donate now](https://donate.straighttraining.center/).

Barcelona is about to become the latest city to play host to a Logos Circle. We’re inviting local cypherpunks, technologists, artists, journalists, activists, charities, and anyone interested in rebuilding civil society in the area to join us at the AKASHA Hub on 9 September. Expect an evening of discussions, collaboration, and planning grassroots solutions to issues facing residents of the Catalan capital. [More information and register your interest](https://lu.ma/gb2tgwiq). 

This month will also see the return of Logos Circle: Brno, which will be held at the Pivnice U Tygra gastropub on 11 September. If you're in the area, head over to meet like-minded people committed to leveraging technologies to defend our liberties. [Learn more and register.](https://luma.com/5scnq4ek)

In addition to Logos Circle: Barcelona, a new Logos Circle will form in the Nigerian city of Benin on 12 September. Hosted at the Magnitron Blockchain Solution & Academy, we invite anyone interested in our principles and applying our technologies to winnable, local issues to join the event. [Learn more and register](https://luma.com/LCBenin1).

Logos Circle: Online is a regular meetup held on X Spaces. The events, held every Tuesday, have brought Circle founders from LA, London, and Africa together to discuss progress toward solving winnable issues in their local communities. Our online circle has grown significantly in the two months since launching the initiative, showing that those in the community and beyond are excited by our movement and building a real community around it. Alongside regular updates from IRL Circles, we’ve discussed _Farewell to Westphalia_, the meaning crisis, left versus right paradigm, political identity, token-economic models, and more.

[Follow Logos on X](https://x.com/Logos_network) and join the next Logos Circle: Online this coming Tuesday.

**Parallel Society** 

We’re thrilled to reveal the date for next year’s Parallel Society: 6–7 March 2026, in Lisbon, Portugal. The event is an international, multi-site convergence of internet pioneers, open-source innovators, underground movements, experimental governance, and bold new cultural imagination.

Parallel Society is more than a festival; it’s a countercultural gathering – a collectively organised, living ecosystem where music, art, and technology intersect. Rooted in innovation, autonomy, and the underground spirit, it is a space for creativity without boundaries. The not-for-profit event will be run by and for the community around it.

After the success of Parallel Society Congress in 2024, we’re doubling down on cultural components for next year’s Parallel Society.
