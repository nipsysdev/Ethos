export default `In 1992 EFF presented our very first awards [recognizing key leaders and organizations](https://www.eff.org/awards/past-winners) advancing innovation and championing civil liberties and human rights online. Now in 2025 we're continuing to celebrate the accomplishments of people working toward a better future for everyone with the EFF Awards!

[All are invited to attend the EFF Awards](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/register?id=498&reset=1) on Wednesday, September 10 at the San Francisco Design Center. Whether you're an activist, an EFF supporter, a student interested in cyberlaw, or someone who wants to munch on a strolling dinner with other likeminded individuals, anyone can enjoy the ceremony!

If you're not able to make it, we'll also be [hosting a livestream of the event](http://www.eff.org/livestream-effawards2025) on Friday, September 12 at 12:00 PM PT. The event will also be recorded, and posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/efforg) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@electronic_frontier_foundation_eff_) after the livestream.

We are honored to present the three winners of this year's EFF Awards: Just Futures Law, Erie Meyer, and Software Freedom Law Center, India. But, before we kick off the ceremony next week, let's take a closer look at each of the honorees. And last, but certainly not least—**Software Freedom Law Center, India, winner of the EFF Award for Defending Digital Freedoms****:**

Software Freedom Law Center, India is a donor-supported legal services organization based in India that brings together lawyers, policy analysts, students, and technologists to protect freedom in the digital world. It promotes innovation and open access to knowledge by helping developers make great free and open-source software, protects privacy and civil liberties for Indians by educating and providing free legal advice, and helps policymakers make informed and just decisions about use of technology. SFLC.IN tracks and participates in litigation, AI regulations, and free speech issues that are defining Indian technology. It also tracks [internet shutdowns](https://internetshutdowns.in/) and [censorship incidents](https://freespeech.sflc.in/) across India, provides [digital security training](https://security.sflc.in/), and has launched the [Digital Defenders Network](https://ddn.sflc.in/), a pan-Indian network of lawyers committed to protecting digital rights. It has conducted landmark litigation cases, petitioned the government of India on freedom of expression and internet issues, and campaigned for WhatsApp and Facebook to fix a feature of their platform that has been used to harass women in India. 

We're excited to celebrate SFLC.IN and the other EFF Award winners in person in San Francisco on September 10! [We hope that you'll join us there.](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/register?id=498&reset=1)
