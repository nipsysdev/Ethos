A Berkeley mathematician sued the State Department  
Tuesday, in a case designed to challenge the government's  
designation of encryption software as a \\\`\\\`munition\'\' subject  
to extensive export controls.

The policy has prevented even the publication of some  
schemes for individuals to protect their computer data or  
electronic mail from eavesdropping. Distributing information  
about many encryption schemes without government approval  
could be a criminal act punishable by 10 years in prison and  
fines of $1 million or more.

Daniel Bernstein, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of  
California, decided to sue after the government told him 18  
months ago he would have to register as an arms dealer under  
the International Traffic in Arms Regulation if he wanted to  
publicize an encryption program he had developed, according to  
his attorney, Cindy Cohn of McGlashan and Sarrail in San  
Mateo.

After reading electronic postings from other  
cryptographers, Bernstein applied for permission to publish  
the program and a paper describing how it works.

The government favors a strict policy because  
computerized methods for sending coded messages have made the  
job of intelligence gathering far more difficult.  
Intelligence agencies have expressed concern that terrorists,  
drug traffickers and hostile foreign governments could obtain  
such string \\[sic\\] encryption software and communicate via  
undecipherable coded messages.

Some of the exhibits filed with the lawsuit that outline  
Bernstein's scheme had to be sealed from public view, Cohn  
said. Attorneys were barred from discussing them because  
making them public could be construed as a criminal act.

Civil liberties groups with computer connections have  
long opposed the government's practice, saying it stifles  
freedom of expression.`;
